## üìö Algorithm Explanation

### Ford-Johnson Merge-Insertion Sort

The Ford-Johnson algorithm, also known as the merge-insertion sort, is an efficient comparison sort algorithm that minimizes the number of comparisons required to sort a list. It works by:

**1. Pairing and Sorting**  
Dividing the input into pairs, sorting each pair, and then recursively sorting these pairs based on their larger elements.

**2. Main Chain and Pending Elements**  
Constructing a main sorted chain and managing a set of pending elements to be inserted.

**3. Jacobsthal Insertion Sequence**  
Utilizing the Jacobsthal sequence to determine the optimal order for inserting pending elements into the main chain, minimizing comparisons. This strategy helps to minimize comparisons by inserting elements from their sorted positions, allowing for more efficient binary searches and fewer comparisons overall.

### Performance Comparison: `std::list` vs `std::vector`

The choice between `std::list` and `std::vector` for implementing sorting algorithms like Ford-Johnson can significantly impact performance, especially with varying dataset sizes:

| Feature                  | `std::vector`                                  | `std::list`                                     |
| :------------------------| :--------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Structure**       | Dynamic array, contiguous memory               | Doubly linked list, non-contiguous memory       |
| **Access Time**          | `O(1)` for random access                       | `O(n)` for random access (sequential iteration) |
| **Insertion/Deletion**   | `O(n)` in the middle, `O(1)` at end            | `O(1)` anywhere (once position is found)        |
| **Cache Locality**       | Excellent, elements are stored contiguously    | Poor, elements can be scattered in memory       |
| **Reallocation**         | May incur overhead when resizing               | No reallocation overhead                        |

**For small datasets (e.g., 3-100 elements):**

-   `std::list` might have an advantage due to less reallocation overhead and faster pointer operations for a small number of elements.
-   Binary search in `std::vector` is `O(log n)` with constant time access, which is generally efficient.

**For large datasets (e.g., 1000+ elements):**

-   `std::vector` typically outperforms `std::list` due to better cache locality, allowing the processor to fetch multiple elements at once.
-   Binary search in `std::list` becomes `O(n)` because it requires sequential iteration to reach elements, making it less efficient for large collections.

This program provides a practical demonstration of these theoretical differences by measuring sorting times for both containers.
